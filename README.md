# Maya Transfer and Inpaint Skin Weights Plugin
Unofficial implementation of <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~rinat/projects/RobustSkinWeightsTransfer/index.html">Robust Skin Weights Transfer via Weight Inpainting</a>, out of Epic Games, as Autodesk Maya plugin.
The official implementation is expected to be published soon. Once available, it will be accessible <a href="https://github.com/rin-23/RobustSkinWeightsTransferCode">here!</a>

## Description
This Autodesk Maya plugin introduces a two-stage skin weight transfer process, enhancing precision and artist control in the rigging of diverse garments. By dividing the process, it ensures better results through initial weight transfer for high-confidence areas, followed by artist-guided interpolation for the rest, boosting both efficiency and quality in character design.
